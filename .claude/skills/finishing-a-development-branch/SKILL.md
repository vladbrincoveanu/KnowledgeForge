# Finishing a Development Branch

**Override note:** This skill extends the Superpowers finishing-a-development-branch skill with a feedback-writing step after merge/PR/abandon.

---

## Feedback Step (added by override)

After executing the chosen option (merge, PR, keep, or discard):

### Write finishing feedback

```bash
FEEDBACK_FILE=~/.claude/memory/feedback/finishing-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
cat > "$FEEDBACK_FILE" << 'FEEDBACK_EOF'
---
name: finishing-feedback-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
type: feedback
---

## Finishing Feedback

**Session:** $(pwd | xargs basename)
**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Outcome:** <merged|pr|kept|discarded>

### What worked
- <note on what went smoothly during finishing>

### What didn't work
- <note on issues encountered>

### Next time try
- <suggestion for improving the finishing process>

### Energy level (1-5)
<1-5 rating>
FEEDBACK_EOF
```

## Original finishing-a-development-branch Skill (preserved)

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Refactoring Gate (Anti-Bloat)

**After tests pass, run refactoring gate BEFORE presenting merge options:**

Run a scan of all changed files since the feature branch split:

- **Module size (>300 lines):** List files exceeding hard limit
- **Function complexity (>3 responsibilities):** Flag complex functions
- **DRY same-file/dir:** Auto-fix repeated logic
- **DRY cross-module:** Flag locations for review
- **Dead imports:** Auto-remove

**Report format:**
Refactoring Gate Results:
- [Auto-fixed] N same-file DRY violations
- [Auto-fixed] N dead import removals
- [Flagged] N module size issues — review before merge
- [Flagged] N cross-module duplications — review before merge

**If any flagged issues:** Present them to user for review decision before proceeding.

**If all clear or user approves flagged issues:** Continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 4: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# If tests pass
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>"
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**

This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)

### Step 6: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1, 2, 4:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

### Step 7: Write feedback

See Feedback Step above.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** (Step 7) - After all tasks complete
- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
